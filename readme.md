### What am I most proud of?

I am most proud of receiving a Cease and Desist from Tumblr.

A while back I did a seemingly harmless school project in which I cloned the well
know website Tumblr. You can read the long version of the story here: [When Tumblrâ„¢ Asked Me to Take Down My School Project](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-tumblr-asked-me-take-down-my-school-project-kat-telles?trk=pulse_spock-articles).
The short version is that the suits at Tumblr somehow either found my clone purely by chance or,
and this is far more likely, came across my site while monitoring domain names similar to their
own for related content. They then sent me a very official sounding Cease and Desist telling me to
either take down the site or pay thousands of dollars in fines. I took this as a major compliment
and to this day break out the story at parties. You can check out my version of Tumblr here: [stumblrr](http://stumblrr.com/).
